# Refactoring application
This repository is for my school assignment where we worked on linking and rendering website files, and how we can route it locally. I refactored my assignment to have some bootstrap eliments and made a drop down for the header.

# How to run

To run this application, just fork it and download it to your computer, then make sure you have HTTP-server downloaded to your computer, and then you can run it as a server.
